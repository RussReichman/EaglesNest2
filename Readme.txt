A collection of "interview code tests" that I have been asked to do in the past, or I have had heard from someone that had to write one of these routines on the spot.

They are simple, yet are complicated enough to make you think, and also avoid errors that would be easy, under a more relaxed situation.

I built for windows. Some of the complex number code may be OS dependent.

If you have any questions, let me know.
